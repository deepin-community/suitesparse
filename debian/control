Description: approximate minimum degree ordering library for sparse matrices
 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
 sparse matrices.
 .
 The AMD library provides a set of routines for pre-ordering sparse matrices
 prior to Cholesky or LU factorization, using the "Approximate Minimum Degree
 ordering" algorithm.

Description: permutation to block triangular form library for sparse matrices
 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
 sparse matrices.
 .
 The BTF library is a software package for permuting a matrix into Block upper
 Triangular Form. It includes a maximum transversal algorithm, which finds a
 permutation of a square or rectangular matrix so that it has a zero-free
 diagonal (if one exists); otherwise, it finds a maximal matching which
 maximizes the number of nonzeros on the diagonal. The package also includes a
 method for finding the strongly connected components of a graph. These two
 methods together give the permutation to block upper triangular form.

Description: column approximate minimum degree ordering library for sparse matrices
 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving

 algorithm. It computes a permutation vector P such that the LU factorization
 of A (:,P) tends to be sparser than that of A. The Cholesky factorization of
 (A (:,P))'*(A (:,P)) will also tend to be sparser than that of A'*A.

 Degree ordering" algorithm. It computes a permutation vector P such that the
 LU factorization of A (:,P) tends to be sparser than that of A. The Cholesky
 factorization of (A (:,P))'*(A (:,P)) will also tend to be sparser than that
 of A'*A.

Description: sparse Cholesky factorization library for sparse matrices
 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
 sparse matrices.
 .
 The CHOLMOD library provides a set of routines for factorizing sparse
 symmetric positive definite matrices of the form A or AA', updating/downdating
 a sparse Cholesky factorization, solving linear systems, updating/downdating
 the solution to the triangular system Lx=b, and many other sparse matrix
 functions for both symmetric and unsymmetric matrices. Its supernodal Cholesky
 factorization relies on LAPACK and the Level-3 BLAS, and obtains a substantial
 fraction of the peak performance of the BLAS.

Description: concise sparse matrix library
 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
 sparse matrices.
 .
 The CXSparse library provides several matrix algorithms. The focus is on direct
 methods; iterative methods and solvers for eigenvalue problems are beyond the
 scope of this package.
 .
 The performance of the sparse factorization methods in CXSparse will not be
 competitive with UMFPACK or CHOLMOD, but the codes are much more concise and
 easy to understand. Other methods are competitive.

 .
 The LDL library provides routines for sparse LDL' factorization and solving.
 These routines are not terrifically fast (they do not use dense matrix
 kernels), but the code is very short and concise. The purpose is to illustrate
 the algorithms in a very concise and readable manner, primarily for
 educational purposes.

 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
 sparse matrices.
 .
 Mongoose is a graph partitioning library that can quickly compute edge cuts in
 arbitrary graph. Given a graph with a vertex set and edge set, an edge cut is
 a partitioning of the graph into two subgraphs that are balanced (contain the
 same number of vertices) and the connectivity between the subgraphs is
 minimized (few edges are in the cut).
 .
 This package contains the shared C++ library.

Description: solves sparse linear systems in exact arithmetic
 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
 sparse matrices.
 .
 SLIP LU is a software package designed to exactly solve unsymmetric sparse
 linear systems, Ax = b, where A, b and x contain rational numbers. This
 package performs a left-looking, roundoff-error-free (REF) LU factorization
 PAQ = LDU, where L and U are integer, D is diagonal, and P and Q are row and
 column permutations, respectively. Note that the matrix D is never explicitly
 computed nor needed; thus this package uses only the matrices L and U.
 .
 This package relies on GNU GMP and MPRF for exact arithmetic computations.
